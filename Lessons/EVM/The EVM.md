# Mastering the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is central to blockchain development and security auditing. A deep understanding of the EVM is crucial for transitioning from beginner to advanced blockchain developer or security researcher. This guide outlines the structure of the EVM, how it processes data during transactions, and offers insights into gas optimizations.

## **1. Data Storage in the EVM**

The EVM has six primary areas for data storage:

### **1.1 Stack**
- A simple Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
- Holds 32-byte words, used for storing immediate values like integers, addresses, and pointers to memory or storage.
- Values are pushed to and popped from the stack.

The stack operates as a LIFO structure, meaning the last value pushed is the first to be popped. Its simplicity allows for efficient manipulation of immediate values.

### Example: Basic Stack Operations
```assembly
PUSH1 0x05    // Pushes the value 5 onto the stack
PUSH1 0x03    // Pushes the value 3 onto the stack
ADD           // Pops 3 and 5, adds them, and pushes the result (8)
PUSH1 0x02    // Pushes the value 2 onto the stack
MUL           // Pops 2 and 8, multiplies them, and pushes the result (16)
```

### **1.2 Memory**
- A temporary, byte-addressable storage area for the duration of a transaction.
- Organized in 32-byte words, but does not use LIFO operations.
- Includes reserved areas for Solidity's internal operations:
  - `0x00` to `0x20`: Scratch space.
  - `0x40`: Free memory pointer (points to the next unused memory slot).
  - `0x60`: Reserved for dynamic arrays.

Memory is allocated dynamically and used for temporary storage. Writing to memory involves paying gas proportional to the size of the memory written.
### Example: Using Memory for Temporary Storage
```assembly
PUSH1 0x10    // Value to store
PUSH1 0x00    // Memory address
MSTORE        // Stores 0x10 at memory address 0x00
PUSH1 0x00    // Memory address
MLOAD         // Loads the value at memory address 0x00 (0x10)
```

### **1.3 Call Data**
- A read-only area containing the data sent to a contract with a transaction.
- Efficient for reading and should be used directly when modification isn't needed.

Call data is an efficient way to pass input parameters to a contract. It remains immutable, making it ideal for functions that only need to read data.

### Example: Reading Call Data
```solidity
function example(uint256 input) external pure returns (uint256) {
    return input * 2;
}
```
```arduino
0x2e64cec1 // Function selector for "example(uint256)"
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005 // Input value
```
### **1.4 Storage**
- Persistent and mapped to specific blockchain accounts.
- Organized in 32-byte slots.
- The most expensive area in terms of gas costs.

Storage is persistent and linked to the contract's state. Writing to storage is gas-intensive.
#### Example: Storage Interaction
```solidiy
uint256 public data;

function storeData(uint256 _data) external {
    data = _data; // Triggers an SSTORE operation
}

function readData() external view returns (uint256) {
    return data; // Triggers an SLOAD operation
}
```

### **1.5 Code**
- Contains the bytecode at a specific contract address.
- Immutable during execution.
The code section is immutable, containing the bytecode executed during contract operations.

### Example: Code Immutability
```solidity
function immutableCode() external pure returns (string memory) {
    return "This is immutable code.";
}
```
### **1.6 Logs**
- A write-only space for emitting events, useful for external applications.

Logs are useful for event-driven architectures and debugging. Events emitted by logs are indexed for efficient retrieval.

### Example: Emitting Events
```solidity
event DataStored(address indexed user, uint256 data);

function storeData(uint256 _data) external {
    emit DataStored(msg.sender, _data);
}
```

## **2. Key Operations in the EVM**

### **2.1 Stack Operations**
- `PUSH`: Adds a 32-byte word to the stack.
- `POP`: Removes the top item from the stack.
- `SWAP`: Reorders items on the stack.

The stack is used to manage intermediate computations.

### Example: SWAP Operation
```assembly
PUSH1 0x01    // Stack: [0x01]
PUSH1 0x02    // Stack: [0x02, 0x01]
SWAP1         // Stack: [0x01, 0x02]
```
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract EVMStackExample {
    function executeStackOperations() public pure returns (uint256, uint256) {
        uint256 a;
        uint256 b;

        assembly {
            // PUSH1 0x01
            a := 1
            // PUSH1 0x02
            b := 2

            // SWAP1
            let temp := a
            a := b
            b := temp
        }

        return (a, b);
    }
}
```

### **2.2 Memory Operations**
- `MSTORE`: Writes a 32-byte word to a specific memory location.
- `MLOAD`: Reads a 32-byte word from a specific memory location.
- `MSTORE8`: Stores a single byte in memory.

Memory serves as a flexible area for computations within a transaction.

### Example: Storing and Loading Data
```assembly
PUSH1 0x2A    // Value to store
PUSH1 0x20    // Memory location
MSTORE        // Store 0x2A at memory location 0x20
PUSH1 0x20    // Memory location
MLOAD         // Load value from 0x20
```

### **2.3 Storage Operations**
- `SSTORE`: Writes to a storage slot (expensive).
- `SLOAD`: Reads from a storage slot.

Storage operations have significant gas implications.

### Example: Writing to Storage
```assembly
PUSH1 0x05    // Value to store
PUSH1 0x00    // Storage slot
SSTORE        // Write value 0x05 to storage slot 0x00
```

## **3. Transaction Execution and Function Calls**

### **3.1 Function Selectors**
- Function selectors are the first 4 bytes of the `keccak256` hash of a function's signature.
- These selectors are used to determine which function to execute within a contract.

Function selectors help determine which function to execute.

### Example: Function Selector Calculation For transfer(address,uint256):
```solidity
keccak256("transfer(address,uint256)") = 0xa9059cbb...
```

### **3.2 Opcode Interpretation**
- The EVM executes bytecode instructions (opcodes), such as `ADD`, `SUB`, and `MUL`.
- Opcodes correspond to specific hexadecimal values (e.g., `0x01` for `ADD`).

Opcodes are the fundamental operations of the EVM.

### Example: Arithmetic Operation
```assembly
PUSH1 0x04    // Push 4
PUSH1 0x02    // Push 2
MUL           // Multiply (4 * 2 = 8)
```

### **3.3 Gas Efficiency Tips**
- Minimize the use of `SSTORE` and `SLOAD` to reduce costs.
- Use `CALLDATA` instead of copying to memory when possible.
- Use smaller function selectors for gas efficiency, as EVM processes them in ascending order for contracts with fewer than four functions.

Efficient use of call data and memory can significantly reduce gas costs.

### Example: Call Data Efficiency
```solidity
function getData(uint256 _input) external pure returns (uint256) {
    return _input * 10; // Process data directly from call data
}
```

---

## **4. Practical Insights**
- **Memory Expansion Costs**: Writing to distant memory addresses increases gas costs exponentially.
- **Call Data Size Checks**: Transactions must include valid call data; otherwise, they revert.
- **Binary Search for Functions**: Contracts with more than four functions use binary search for function selectors, ensuring scalability.

Memory Expansion Costs Writing to a memory address far from the current pointer can exponentially increase gas costs.

### Example: Inefficient Memory Expansion
```assembly
PUSH1 0x20    // Value
PUSH1 0x8000  // Far memory address
MSTORE        // Expands memory significantly
```

Call Data Size Checks Improper call data size can result in reversion.

### Example: Checking Call Data

```solidity
require(msg.data.length >= 4, "Invalid call data");
```

Binary Search for Functions Efficient handling of large function sets ensures scalability.

### Example: Binary Search Implementation

```solidity
function findFunction(bytes4 selector) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    // Binary search logic
}
```
